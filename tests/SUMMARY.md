# Testing Improvements Summary

## Challenges Identified

1. **Authentication Issues**: NextAuth implementation in tests was not working reliably, likely due to session handling, redirects, or cookie management.
2. **Selector Problems**: Many tests were using label-based selectors that resolved to multiple elements.
3. **Test Organization**: Tests needed better categorization to separate those requiring authentication from those that don't.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Improved Utility Functions**: 
   - Updated `utils.ts` with more reliable selector strategies
   - Created consistent authentication functions

2. **Test Categorization**: 
   - **Basic Tests** (`*-basic.spec.ts`): Don't require authentication
   - **UI Component Tests** (`ui-components.spec.ts`): Focus on visual appearance
   - **Auth-specific Tests** (`*.auth.spec.ts`): Run with storage state

3. **Test Preparation Script**: 
   - Added `prepare-tests.ts` that attempts authentication
   - Creates required directories and storage state
   - Falls back to empty state if authentication fails

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added detailed `README.md` with guidance on authentication issues
   - Added scripts for running specific test subsets
   - Added debugging tips and workarounds

5. **Package.json Scripts**:
   - Added `test:prepare` to handle preparation
   - Added `test:basic` to run only unauthenticated tests

## Recommended Testing Approach

1. **Development and Manual Testing**:
   - Focus on basic tests during development: `pnpm test:basic`
   - Use manual testing to verify authenticated features

2. **CI/CD Testing**:
   - Run basic tests for quick feedback
   - Consider using environment-specific authentication for full test coverage

3. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - For local development: Run `pnpm test:prepare` before tests
   - For production: Configure CI with proper test users

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Authentication Issues**:
   - Review NextAuth implementation to understand why automated tests fail
   - Consider creating dedicated test users with simplified auth flows

2. **Expand Basic Test Coverage**:
   - Add more tests that don't require authentication
   - Create more mocks/stubs where possible

3. **Consider Test Framework Enhancements**:
   - Look into custom fixtures or test utilities
   - Consider API-based authentication bypass for testing

4. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Expand UI component tests for visual consistency
   - Add screenshot comparisons for key components
