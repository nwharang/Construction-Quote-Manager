## Your Quotes: From Creation to Customer

This is where the action happens! The "Quotes" section is where you'll build price estimates for your customers, keep track of them, and send them out.

## Why Is This Section So Important?

Good quotes win jobs. This tool is designed to help you create quotes that are:

*   **Professional and Clear:** Impress your customers with well-organized and easy-to-understand quotes.
*   **Accurate:** By using your saved customer and product information, you reduce the chance of errors.
*   **Fast to Create:** Build even complex quotes more quickly by easily adding your services and materials.
*   **Easy to Track:** Keep a history of all your quotes, see their status (like "Draft," "Sent," or "Accepted"), and know their values.

##The Journey of a Quote

Here's how you'll typically work with quotes in the app:

1.  **Finding Your Quotes:**
    *   Click on "Quotes" in the main menu. This shows you a list of all the quotes you've created.
    *   You can usually search or filter this list to find specific quotes quickly.

2.  **Starting a New Quote:**
    *   Look for a "Create Quote" or "New Quote" button.
    *   You'll start by giving your quote a title or reference and selecting a customer (either from your existing list or by adding a new one on the spot).

3.  **Building Your Quote - Adding Tasks and Materials:**
    *   This is the core of the quote. You'll add "Tasks" (which represent the labor or services) and "Materials" (the items or products needed).
    *   **Tasks:** For each task, describe what needs to be done and how much you're charging for that labor.
    *   **Materials:**
        *   You can often choose between a "Lump Sum" for materials (one total cost for all materials in that task) or an "Itemized" list (adding each material one by one, pulling from your product list).
        *   Using itemized materials from your product list is fast and accurate!
    *   The app will usually calculate totals for you as you add items.

4.  **Adding Other Details (Optional but good!):**
    *   **Terms and Conditions:** You might have a place to add your standard payment terms or other important notes for the customer.
    *   **Discounts or Markups:** Some systems allow you to apply overall discounts or markups.
    *   **Validity Date:** How long is the quote good for?

5.  **Review and Save:**
    *   Always look over your quote to make sure everything is correct.
    *   Save your quote. It might be saved as a "Draft" first.

6.  **Sending the Quote to Your Customer:**
    *   Once you're happy with the draft, you'll likely have an option to mark it as "Sent."
    *   The app might help you email it directly, or you might download it as a PDF to send yourself.

7.  **Tracking the Quote's Status:**
    *   After sending, you can update the quote's status in the app â€“ for example, to "Accepted" if the customer agrees, or "Declined" if they don't. This helps you keep track of your sales pipeline.

8.  **Viewing or Printing:**
    *   You can always view your saved quotes. There's usually an option to view a print-friendly version too.

Creating clear, accurate, and professional quotes is a key part of running a successful business. This tool is here to make that process much easier for you!
