## Your Products & Services List: The Key to Fast Quotes

The "Products" section is where you list all the services you offer or items you sell. Think of it as your business's catalog. Keeping this up-to-date is essential for creating accurate and speedy quotes.

## Why Is Your Product List So Important?

A well-managed product list is a cornerstone of efficient quoting:

*   **Accuracy is Key:** Ensures you're using the correct prices and descriptions for your services or items every single time you create a quote.
*   **Speed Up Quoting:** Once a product is in your list, you can add it to a quote with just a few clicks. No need to type out the details from scratch each time!
*   **Consistency Matters:** Standardizes how your products and services are named and described across all your quotes, making you look more professional.
*   **Foundation for the Future:** While this app might focus on quoting now, a good product list could be used for things like inventory tracking if that feature is added later.

## How to Manage Your Products and Services

1.  **Go to Products:** Find "Products" in the main menu on the side of your screen and click it. You'll see a list of all products and services you've already added.

2.  **Adding a New Product or Service:**
    *   Look for a "Create Product" or "Add New Product" button.
    *   You'll see a form asking for details:
        *   **Name:** What do you call this product or service? (e.g., "Standard Garden Maintenance," "Premium Light Fixture," "Hourly Consulting Rate"). Make it clear and easy to understand.
        *   **Description (Optional but Recommended):** A bit more detail about what it includes. This can be helpful for you and can also appear on the quote for your customer.
        *   **Price:** How much does it cost?
        *   **Unit (Sometimes):** How do you measure it? (e.g., "per hour," "each," "per square foot").
        *   **Category (Optional):** If you use categories, you can assign this product to one.
    *   Fill in the details and click "Save Product."

3.  **Finding and Viewing Product Details:**
    *   You can browse or search your product list. Clicking on a product name will usually show you all its saved information.

4.  **Changing Product Information (Editing):**
    *   Need to update a price or description? Find the product in your list and click the "Edit" button (often a pencil icon).
    *   Make your changes and save them. This is important for keeping your quotes accurate!

5.  **Removing a Product:**
    *   If you no longer offer a product or service, you can remove it from the list using a "Delete" button (often a trash can icon).
    *   Be sure before deleting, as it might affect old quotes if you need to look them up.

## How Products Make Quoting Easier

When you're building a new quote, you'll be able to easily search and select items directly from your product list. The name, description, and price will be pulled into the quote automatically. This is where all the effort of maintaining your product list really pays off by saving you a lot of time and helping to prevent errors.

A little time spent keeping your product list accurate will make a big difference in how quickly and professionally you can create quotes!
