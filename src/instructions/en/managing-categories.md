## Keeping Your Products Tidy with Categories

If you offer a lot of different products or services, categories can be a big help in keeping them organized. This makes it quicker to find what you need when you're putting together a quote.

## Why Use Categories? (And When You Might Not Need Them)

Imagine your product list is like a big toolbox. If you only have a few tools, you can find everything easily. But if you have hundreds, it's much better if they're sorted into smaller trays (like "Wrenches," "Screwdrivers," etc.). That's what categories do for your products.

*   **Good for:** Businesses with many diverse products or services.
*   **Maybe Not Needed If:** You have a small, straightforward list of products.

**Benefits of Using Categories:**

*   **Find Products Faster:** When you're adding items to a quote, you can quickly look inside a specific category instead of scrolling through everything.
*   **Clearer Overview:** It's easier to see what types of products or services you offer.

## How to Manage Your Categories

1.  **Go to Categories:** Look for "Categories" in the main menu on the side of your screen and click it. This is where you'll see a list of any categories you've already made.

2.  **Creating a New Category:**
    *   Click the "Create Category" button.
    *   Give your category a clear name (e.g., "Lighting Fixtures," "Installation Services," "Garden Supplies").
    *   You might also be able to add a short description if you want.
    *   Save it, and it will appear in your list.

3.  **Changing or Removing a Category:**
    *   In the list of categories, you'll usually see options next to each one to "Edit" or "Delete" it.
    *   **Editing:** Click "Edit" to change its name or description.
    *   **Deleting:** Click "Delete" if you no longer need a category. (Don't worry, deleting a category usually doesn't delete the products *inside* it; they just won't be in that category anymore).

## Using Categories When Adding Products

When you add a new product or service to your main product list, you'll usually have an option to assign it to one of your categories. This is how you "put the tool in the right tray."

That's the basics of categories! They're a simple but powerful way to keep your product list manageable as your business grows.
