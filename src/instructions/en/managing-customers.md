## Keeping Track of Your Customers

Having your customer information organized and easy to access is a big help when you're creating quotes and managing your business. This guide shows you how to use the "Customers" section of the app.

## Why Keep a Customer List in the App?

Think of this section as your digital address book, but specifically for your business contacts. It offers some great advantages:

*   **Save Time on Quotes:** When you create a new quote, you can quickly select an existing customer, and their details (like name and address) will often fill in automatically. No more typing the same info over and over!
*   **Stay Organized:** All your customer contact details are in one place, easy to find and update.
*   **Look Professional:** Using correct and consistent customer information on your quotes shows you're on top of things.
*   **Build Relationships (Potentially):** Some systems might let you add notes about customers (like preferences or past jobs), helping you provide more personal service.

## How to Manage Your Customer Information

1.  **Go to Customers:** In the main menu on the side of your screen, click on "Customers." This will show you your list of existing customers.

2.  **Adding a New Customer:**
    *   Look for a button that says "Create Customer" or "Add New Customer."
    *   A form will appear where you can enter their details:
        *   **Name:** The customer's name or company name.
        *   **Contact Info:** Email, phone number, address, etc.
    *   Fill in as much information as you have. The more complete it is, the more helpful it will be later.
    *   Click "Save Customer" (or a similar button).

3.  **Finding and Viewing Customer Details:**
    *   In your customer list, you can usually click on a customer's name to see all the details you've saved for them.

4.  **Changing Customer Information (Editing):**
    *   When you're viewing a customer's details, or sometimes directly from the list, you should see an "Edit" button (often a pencil icon).
    *   Click it to make changes to their name, contact info, or any other details.
    *   Remember to save your changes.

5.  **Removing a Customer:**
    *   If you need to remove a customer from your list, look for a "Delete" button (often a trash can icon), either on their details page or next to their name in the list.
    *   The system will usually ask you to confirm before deleting, just to be safe.

## Using Customers When Creating Quotes

The real magic happens when you create a quote. You'll typically be able to search for and select a customer from your list, and the app will pull their information into the quote for you. This is a major time-saver!

Keeping your customer list accurate and up-to-date will make your quoting process smoother and your business run more efficiently.
