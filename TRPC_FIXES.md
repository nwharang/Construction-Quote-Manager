# tRPC Error Fixes

This document details the changes made to fix tRPC issues, particularly the "Failed to fetch quotes" error.

## 1. API Client Improvements

In `src/utils/api.ts`:

- Enhanced the `httpBatchLink` configuration:
  - Added custom `fetch` implementation to prevent caching
  - Added proper headers with client source information
  - Set `cache: 'no-store'` to prevent stale data issues

- Improved retry logic:
  - Added intelligent retry mechanism that doesn't retry on 404s or auth errors
  - Implemented exponential backoff (delay increases between retries)
  - Added specific retry options for quote-related queries
  - Set appropriate timeout values

- Managed aborted requests:
  - Set `abortOnUnmount: true` to properly clean up requests

## 2. Enhanced Error Handling

In `src/utils/error-handler.ts`:

- Added `handleNetworkError` function:
  - Detects common network error patterns including "Failed to fetch"
  - Provides appropriate user-friendly messages
  - Determines if errors should be retried

- Updated `handleClientError` to use network error detection:
  - Checks for network errors first as they're most common with tRPC
  - Improves error message clarity for end users
  - Maintains proper error type classification

## 3. UI Improvements

In quote-related pages:

- Added `QuoteLoadingError` component:
  - Provides a user-friendly error display
  - Includes a retry button to immediately retry failed requests
  - Shows contextual messages based on error type

- Updated error states in all data-fetching components:
  - Shows proper loading states
  - Handles errors gracefully
  - Provides retry mechanisms

## 4. Documentation

- Updated `TRPC_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`:
  - Added section about "Failed to fetch" errors
  - Documented common solutions for network-related issues
  - Provided implementation details

- Created this `TRPC_FIXES.md` document to record changes

## 5. Core Issues Addressed

The primary issues fixed were:

1. **Network Error Handling**: Improved detection and handling of network-related errors
2. **Retry Mechanisms**: Added intelligent retry logic to automatically recover from temporary issues
3. **Error UI**: Enhanced error UI to provide better user experience when errors occur
4. **Connection Issues**: Addressed underlying connection issues with proper fetch configuration
5. **Error Clarity**: Improved error messages to be more descriptive and actionable

These changes align with the project guidelines in `CONTEXT.md`, particularly:
- Guideline #27: "Maintain high standard for code, logic, and testing"
- The error handling section under "Data Handling" which emphasizes user-friendly notifications and automatic error recovery

## Testing

To verify these fixes:
1. Try loading the quotes page with network connectivity
2. Temporarily disable network connectivity and observe graceful error handling
3. Re-enable connectivity and use the retry button to recover
4. Check server logs for any remaining issues

By addressing these issues, we've significantly improved the robustness of the application when dealing with network-related problems, especially the "Failed to fetch quotes" error.
